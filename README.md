🔢 Sorting Visualizer
A dynamic and interactive web-based Sorting Visualizer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project visualizes various sorting algorithms in action, helping learners and developers
understand how sorting works through animation and comparison.

🚀 Features
Visualize popular sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Adjust array size and sorting speed

Generate new arrays on demand

Highlight comparisons and sorted elements

One-click "Compare All" feature to benchmark all algorithms

Clean, responsive UI

📸 Demo

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 – Structure and layout

CSS3 – Styling and responsive design

JavaScript (ES6) – Core logic and animations

📂 Folder Structure
bash
Copy code

├── style.css         # Styling for UI
└── script.js         # Logic and sorting algorithms
🧠 How It Works
Each sorting algorithm is implemented as an async function to allow visual animations with delays between operations.
Bars representing array elements are dynamically generated and updated during the sort.

💡 Getting Started
Run Locally
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git
Open index.html in your browser.

No dependencies or setup required.

🎯 Future Enhancements
Add more sorting algorithms (e.g., Radix Sort, Shell Sort)

Display number of comparisons and swaps

Allow step-by-step execution

Add theme toggle (light/dark)
